# Custom Templates
This directory contains custom docker-compose files, that use the Docker Images created by prind.  

These files are not part of prind and are geared towards more experienced users. Their aim is to provide a starting point for more complex setups. Documentation from the main README does not apply. Docker and Docker Compose knowledge is strongly recommended as Support for these configurations is limited.  
  
Comments at the beginning of each file describe the usecase and necessary steps to get them to work.
