# Custom Templates
This directory contains custom docker-compose files, that use the Docker Images created by prind but not the actual `docker-compose.yaml` of prind.  
  
These files are geared towards more experienced users and aim to provide a starting point for more complex setups. Documentation from the main Readme does only apply partially or not at all.
Docker and Docker Compose knowledge is strongly recommended as Support for these custom configurations is limited.  
  
Comments at the beginning of each file describe the usecase and necessary steps to get them to work.
