# ustreamer packaged in Docker
## What is ustreamer?

>µStreamer is a lightweight and very quick server to stream MJPEG video from any V4L2 device to the net. All new browsers have native support of this video format, as well as most video players such as mplayer, VLC etc. µStreamer is a part of the Pi-KVM project designed to stream VGA and HDMI screencast hardware data with the highest resolution and FPS possible.

## Usage
By default, ustreamer is looking for device `/dev/video0`. A docker device binding can be utilized to provide this device without the need to change the default CMD.

#### Run
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 --device /dev/video0:/dev/video0 ghcr.io/mkuf/prind/ustreamer:latest
```
#### Compose
```yaml
services:
  ustreamer:
    image: ghcr.io/mkuf/prind/ustreamer:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    devices:
      - /dev/video0:/dev/video0
```
