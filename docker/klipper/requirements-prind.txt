## This file contains additional requirements
## Packages defined here will be installed prior to klippy requirements
## 
numpy==1.26.4
# this is a workaround as setuptools is no longer installed in venvs since python 3.12
# klippy is installing python-can==3.3.4 which requires setuptools to be present
# May be removed if python-can has been upgraded upstream in https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/pull/6557.
